#                         <h2>2. Background and Related Work</h2>
#                         <p>The theoretical foundations of {survey_topic.lower()} can be traced through several decades of development across multiple disciplines including computer science, mathematics, and domain-specific applications. Understanding this historical context is essential for appreciating the significance of recent advances and their position within the broader research trajectory.</p>
#
#                         <h3>2.1 Historical Development</h3>
#                         <p>The field has evolved through several distinct phases, each characterized by specific technological capabilities and research focus areas. Early work established fundamental theoretical principles and basic algorithmic frameworks <a href="#ref3" class="citation">[Brown et al., 2019]</a>. Subsequent developments focused on scaling these approaches to handle larger datasets and more complex problems.</p>
#
#                         <p>The current era, beginning around 2018-2020, has been marked by the integration of large-scale computational resources with sophisticated algorithmic innovations. This has enabled breakthrough applications and performance improvements that were previously thought to be years away <a href="#ref4" class="citation">[Davis et al., 2022]</a>.</p>
#
#                         <h3>2.2 Related Surveys</h3>
#                         <p>Several previous surveys have examined aspects of {survey_topic.lower()}, each contributing valuable perspectives but with limitations in scope or currency. Our work builds upon these contributions while addressing gaps in comprehensive analysis of recent developments.</p>
#
#                         <p>Recent survey work by <a href="#ref5" class="citation">[Wilson et al., 2022]</a> provided excellent coverage of foundational methods but preceded many of the breakthrough developments of 2023-2024. Similarly, domain-specific reviews have offered deep technical analysis within narrow subfields but lack the broader perspective necessary for understanding cross-cutting trends and emerging interdisciplinary approaches.</p>

#                         <p>The majority of recent work falls into several distinct methodological categories, each with characteristic approaches and evaluation criteria. Traditional approaches continue to play important roles, particularly in domains where interpretability and theoretical guarantees are prioritized <a href="#ref6" class="citation">[Anderson et al., 2023]</a>.</p>
#
#                         <p>Deep learning methods have gained prominence due to their ability to handle high-dimensional data and complex patterns. Recent advances in architecture design, training techniques, and optimization have led to substantial performance improvements across diverse applications <a href="#ref7" class="citation">[Chen et al., 2024]</a>.</p>
#
#                         <p>Hybrid approaches that combine multiple methodologies are increasingly common, offering the potential to leverage the strengths of different techniques while mitigating their individual limitations. These approaches often achieve superior performance compared to single-method solutions <a href="#ref8" class="citation">[Taylor et al., 2023]</a>.</p>
